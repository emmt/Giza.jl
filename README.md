# Giza.jl

This package is for scientific plotting in Julia with the [Giza
library](https://github.com/danieljprice/giza).

Giza relies on [Cairo](https://cairographics.org/) for producing scientific
plots in various formats (interactive X window, PDF, (E)PS, PNG, etc.)

Giza was inspired by the [PGPLOT
library](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/) and provides an [almost
complete
replacement](https://github.com/danieljprice/giza/blob/master/docs/documentation/cpgplot-status.html)
of PGPLOT.

In its current state, Giza.jl binds almost all functions of Giza into Julia
(the only missing ones are the routines for plotting functions which can be
easily emulated in Julia).

Calling:

```julia
using Giza
```

brings all Giza constants into scope, all these constants start with `GIZA_`.
Giza method are not imported but their names have been shortened, hence:
`giza_open_device` becomes `Giza.open_device`.  None of the `giza_*_float`
functions are directly accessible, but get automatically called when all
floating-point array/vector arguments are in single precision.  For example, to
draw a curve, just call `Giza.line` and the most appropriate of `giza_line` or
`giza_line_float` will be used.

An exception is `giza_round` (which round its argument to some *nice* value)
which is binded as `Giza.nice_number` because `round` has another meaning in
Julia.

The Julia methods known the sizes/lengths of the arrays/vectors passed as
argument, so these arguments are omitted in the argument list.  For instance
the C call:

```c
giza_contour(xdim, ydim, arr, 0, xdim - 1, 0, ydim - 1, n, cont, aff);
```

to plot `n` countours at levels `cont` in `xdim Ã— ydim` array `arr` with affine
coordinate transform `aff`, becomes in Julia:

```julia
giza_contour(arr, cont, aff)
```

Output arguments are also omitted in the argument list and methods which
return one or several values return this value or a tuple of values.  For
instance the C call:

```c
int fillstyle, angle, cutback;
giza_get_arrow_style(&fillstyle, &angle, &cutback);
```

becomes in Julia:

```julia
fillstyle, angle, cutback = Giza.get_arrow_style()
```

For plotting 2D arrays (colored/grayscaled cells, contours, fields of vectors),
the sub-region indices are not part of the arguments in the Julia version.
Plotting a sub-region is easily achieved by using *views* (FIXME: loss of
efficiency will be fixed soon).


## Installation

After cloning the Git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emmt/Giza.jl.git
```

go to the `dep` sub-directory of the repository and build the `deps.jl` file as
follows:

```sh
cd "Giza.jl/deps"
make GIZA_JL_DLL="$PATH_TO_GIZA_DLL" rebuild
```

where `"$PATH_TO_GIZA_DLL"` is the name or the path to the Giza dynamic library
to use.
